## Overview
### The architecture is composed by four services:

   * [`micro-eureka-server`](Service **Discovery Server** created with Eureka
   * [`micro-api-getway`]API Gateway created with Zuul that uses the discovery-service to send the requests to the services. It uses Ribbon as a Load Balancer
   * [`micro-auth-service`] Simple REST service created with `Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Oauth2, Spring Data JPA, MySQL` to use as an **authorization service**
   * [`micro-user-service`]Simple REST service created with `Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL` to use as a **resource service**

### Tools you will need

* Maven 3.0+ is your build tool
* Your favorite IDE but we will recommend `STS-4-4.4.1 version`. We use STS.
* MySQL server
* JDK 1.8+

### Microservice Running Process:

- First we need to run `eureka service`
- Second we need to run `auth-service`
- Third we need to run `user-servic` 
- Finally we need to run `gateway-service`, if we did run `gateway-service` before running `auth-service and iteam,sales-service` then we have to wait approximately 10 second
